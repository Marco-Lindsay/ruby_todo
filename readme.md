# _Assingment_
Using nested routes create an app that allows for the creation of lists with multiple steps. "Each how-to guide should have nested CRUD-able steps. Eg: localhost:3000/lists/5/steps/3 should show the 3rd step of the 5th list. You don't have to name your resources "list" and "step", though, you can be more creative. You don't need any auth/auth for this assignment."

### Approach
Both http://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html and http://railscasts.com/episodes/139-nested-resources were extremely helpful in completing this assingment.
